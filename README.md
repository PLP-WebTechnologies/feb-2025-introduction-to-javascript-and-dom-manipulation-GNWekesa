# Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Objectives

Write basic JavaScript functions.
Manipulate the DOM dynamically.
Respond to user interactions.

## Instructions

- Create a script.js file and link it to a HTML.
- Structure the document using DOCTYPE, html, head, and body.

>[!NOTE]
>  - Write JavaScript that:
>  - Changes text content dynamically.
>  - Modifies CSS styles via JavaScript.
>  - Adds or removes an element when a button is clicked.


# Tasks
- Create a well-structured HTML5 document.
- Use at least 5 different HTML elements.
- Ensure semantic correctness.

Explanation:
HTML (index.html):

The index.html contains the structure of your page with a title and some content.

It links to an external script.js file for the JavaScript functionality.

There are three buttons that trigger different JavaScript functions when clicked.

JavaScript (script.js):

The script selects the buttons and the text element.

Three separate functions are written to:

Change the text content dynamically when the "Change Text" button is clicked.

Modify the CSS styles of the text (like color, font size, and font family) when the "Change Style" button is clicked.

Add a new <p> element to the body when the "Add Element" button is clicked.

CSS (style.css):

Optional styles are applied to the body, buttons, and text to make the page look neat and user-friendly.

Result:
When you click the "Change Text" button, the text inside the <p> element will change.

When you click the "Change Style" button, the style of the text will change (e.g., the color will turn blue).

When you click the "Add Element" button, a new paragraph will be added to the page dynamically.

This is a simple example of JavaScript DOM manipulation that meets the objectives: writing basic JavaScript functions, manipulating the DOM dynamically, and responding to user interactions.
